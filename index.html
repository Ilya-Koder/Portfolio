      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        Originally from a small fjord in the northwest of Norway, I am a
        25-year-old male who enjoys gaming and playing the trumpet in my free
        time. I discovered my passion for working with my hands at the age of 17
        and became skilled in fixing and creating things, which led me to become
        a CNC Machinist/Operator. After working in the field for a few years, I
        faced a medical condition that set me on a journey to recovery. Though
        the cause remains unclear, I have learned to manage it better. During
        this time, I pursued my general competency education and began studying
        frontend development. I have always been fascinated by tinkering and
        discovered a love for website creation and coding, especially with HTML,
        CSS, and JavaScript. My knowledge continues to grow as I advance in my
        development career.
